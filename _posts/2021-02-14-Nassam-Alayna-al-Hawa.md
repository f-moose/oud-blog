## tldr
My recording of Nassam Alayna al-hawah played alongside the original track.  
Recorded on Christmas day during the lockdown of 2020. A 'gift' for mum seeing as this is her favourite Fairouz song :) 

Yallah, emshee! 

Oh, by the by, a link to the original track should anyone wish to listen to it without my mumbo jumbo. [Sparkle sparkle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zW1kdmGins&ab_channel=Fairuz-Topic)

-Analysis-  
 Generally speaking I'm quite happy with the way this came out. There are a few areas I think can I can improve upon however: 

1. Incorrect notes. At times I accidentally hit a note on the wrong string or briefly lose my place in the song. 

2. Timing. I think I start off quite strong but as the song progresses I occasionally come in too early or a little too late. 

3. Tremolo. I'm really happy with the progress I've made with my tremolo technique overall, although it's still not as smooth or fluid as I'd like it to be. 

4. Ornamentation. More specifically, qarar and jawab. When played solo I do incorporate qarar and jawab which I feel really adds to the piece, but I feel like it gets drowned out a bit in a 'full band' context. There's also the barrier of playing qurar and jawab at this speed, when I play the piece solo I slow the song down a bit which allows me to add those sweet sweet bass notes. Also, interestingly, it changes up the entire feel of the song. Having learned the piece before become familiar with the actual song, it's surprising how much more 'melancholic' I would make it sound

### Bonus tingz

_P.S. My mind totes went blank around the 2:30 mark, lewl. Everything from that point onwards is improvised._
