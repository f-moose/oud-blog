## tldr
A'ite. My first proper recording. Playing along to a classic (one of that i've only just discovered). To listen to the track without my mumbo jumbo, [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zW1kdmGins&ab_channel=Fairuz-Topic)


## My turn

-Notes to self-  
 Generally speaking I'm quite happy with the way this came out. There are a few areas I think can be improved upon however, these include: 

1. Incorrect notes. At times I accidentally hit a note on the wrong string or briefly lose my place in the song. 

2. Timing. I think I start off quite strong but as the song progresses I occasionally come in too early or a little too late. 

3. Tremolo. I'm really happy with the progress I've made with my tremolo technique overall, although it's still not as smooth or fluid as I'd like it to be. 

4. Ornamentation. More specifically, qarar and jawab. When played solo I do incorporate qarar and jawab which I feel really adds to the piece, but I feel like it gets drowned out a bit in a 'full band' context. There's also the barrier of playing qurar and jawab at this speed, when I play the piece solo I slow the song down a bit which allows me to add those sweet sweet bass notes. Also, interestingly, it changes up the entire feel of the song. Having learned the piece before become familiar with the actual song, it's surprising how much more 'melancholic' I would make it sound

### Bonus tingz
