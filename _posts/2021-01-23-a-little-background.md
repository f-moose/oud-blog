### Wagwan
Alright. Okay. I think I'm finally ready to actually start writing. Let's. Make. Magic. 

Welcome to my little experiment. 

What's going on exactly? Well, more than anything I'd like to use this as a platform to record my thoughts and progress around my oud-playing journey. A space where I can record and upload videos of myself reciting pieces set by my teachers, set myself goals and challenges and generally try to improve as an oud player and as a musician.  
_Side note - it's also a niffty excuse to try out some web technologies I've been curious to learn more about ;)_


### A little background.
I'm not going to spend too much time writing about what would undoubtedly be an uninteresting tale that led to my picking up the oud.  
... It would include an origins story where a little boy wakes up to sounds of Oum Kalthoum and Abdel Halim Hafez, where he would watch old Egyptian movies with his father and listen to stories about grand Arabic musicians...  
_Fast. Fucking. Forward._  

Roughly 4 years ago I had decided that I wanted to learn to play the Oud. I had some experience playing guitar and thought that picking up the oud would be straightforward enough. Anywho, as luck would have it, Bubz (my dad) and I were scheduled to be in Egypt soon. I used this as an opportunity to do some research, source an oud from a reputable luthier and start shredding. Only two of those three things came to be. Whilst trawling the internet was informative, and finding an oud that fit my needs wasn't too much hassle, shredding on the thing was just not happenin'.  

It quickly became apparent that playing the oud the way one would play a guitar was not that right approach to take. Everything from tuning to hand positioning and technique felt almost alien. Whilst I had plenty of practice holding chords shapes and running through scale patterns, I struggled to even find the right notes on an oud.

So yeah, I quickly became discouraged with my lack of progress.  
I'm ashamed to say that this eventually led to the hiding my oud deep within a wardrobe somewhere for many years. A humble prison where it lay asleep, waiting patiently to awake from its slumber. But fear not, for wake it did my friends, when years later I happened upon a school based in central London which specialised in the teaching of all things oud. Amazing!  
A small spark which led to fiery blaze, ignited by the wise and mystical folk at Taqasim Music School. With their tutelage I began the beginner Oud and Arabic music theory course and have been on a quest for oud mastery ever since. Patience is highly recommended.
