### Wagwan
Alright. Okay. I think I'm finally ready to actually start writing. Let's. Make. Magic. 

Welcome to my little experiment. 

What's going on exactly? Well, more than anything I'd like to use this as a platform to record my thoughts and progress around my oud-playing journey. A space where I can record and upload videos of myself reciting pieces set by my teachers, set myself goals and challenges and generally try to improve as an oud player and as a musician.  
_Side note - it's also a niffty excuse to try out some web technologies I've been curious to learn more about ;)_


### A little background.
I'm not going to spend too much time writing about what would undoubtedly be an uninteresting tale which led to my picking up the oud. It would include an origins story where a little boy wakes up to sounds of Oum Kalthoum and Abdel Halim Hafez, where he would watch old Egyptian movies with his father and listen to stories grand Arabic musicians...  
_Fast. Fucking. Forward._  
I'll spare y'all the agony and cut to the relevant bits to help give this blog a bit more context. 

Roughly 4 years ago I had decided that I wanted to learn to play the Oud. I had some experience playing guitar and thought that picking up the oud would be a straightforward transition. Anywho, as luck would have it, Bubz (my dad) and I were scheduled to be in Egypt soon. I used this as an opportunity to do some research, source an oud from a reputable luthier and get shredding. Only two of those three things came to be. Whilst trawling the internet was informative, and finding an oud that fit my needs wasn't too much hassle, shredding on the thing was just not happenin'.  

It quickly became apparent that playing the oud the way one would play a guitar was not that right approach to take. Everything from tuning to hand positioning and technique felt almost alien. Whilst I had plenty of practice holding chords shapes and running through scale patterns, I struggled to even find the right notes on an oud.

So yeah, I quickly became discouraged with my lack of progress. Somewhat unsurprisingly, the internet did not contain the same wealth of beginner tutorials and courses for oud as it does for guitar, which I'm ashamed to say led its temporary exile, sent away to a distant wardrobe somewhere.  
Imprisoned, for a crime it did not commit. Innocent and alone. Waiting patiently to awake from its slumber. Like the majestic phoenix, and like the majestic phoenix... rise it did.  
A spark which led to fiery blaze, ignited by the wise and mystical folk at Taqasim Music School.  
With their tutelage I began their beginner Oud and Arabic music theory course and have not looked back since. It has re-kindled my excitement to learn and my joy to play. So yes, welcome. Welcome to the inner thoughts of a lvl. 1 string slinger on his quest to becoming an Oud Wizard.
